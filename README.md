# Network Intrusion Detection System 

#### It's still a work in progress.....for now there's a simple network sniffer. It's gonna be extended to be able to read more details from packets and then compare it with the patterns of common attack patterns and then create alerts based on those observations. 
#### Edit: Now there's even port scanner along with the packet sniffer. 
#### Edit: Now the port scanner and packet sniffer can be executed through the nids.py. It's all command-line based interface.
