### First task submission of CodeAlpha's Cybersecurity Internship. 
#### This is a very basic network sniffer coded using Python (Scapy) which reads the packets transferred over the local network and displays their protocol, mainly ARP, UDP, TCP/IP, ICMP, DNS (Query and Response). It also logs the captured packet data with its respective timestamp into a log file, and each time the program is run, the new data is appended into the file. Ctrl+C is used to stop the execution of the sniffer, copying the default functionality in Linux terminal.
